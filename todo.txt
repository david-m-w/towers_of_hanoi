agent for normal game (3 towers)
n tower testing
n tower and m rings formula for optimal solution
game with randomized start (stil legal, maybe not leagal starting pos.
maybe a non legal positions is not solvable?
maybe randomized positions, even when legal, are non solvable sometimes?)
agent to play n towers
agent to play n towers randomized
make the __str__ function capable of higlighting a tower (like the target tower)
maybe for that make a variable in the class that marks the target tower.
and a function to change it
also maybe add functions to reset or randomize the gamestate, or set a custom one
