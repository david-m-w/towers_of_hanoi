agent for normal game (3 towers)
n tower testing
n tower and m rings formula for optimal solution
game with randomized start (stil legal, maybe not leagal starting pos.
maybe a non legal positions is not solvable?
maybe randomized positions, even when legal, are non solvable sometimes?)
agent to play n towers
agent to play n towers randomized
also maybe add functions to /*reset or randomize*/ the gamestate, or set a custom one
